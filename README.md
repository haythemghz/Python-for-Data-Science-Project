# Python for Data Science 2: Guided Machine Learning Project

**Tutor:** [Haythem Ghazouani](https://github.com/haythemghz)

## Course Overview
This repository contains the materials for the **Python for Data Science 2** module. This is a 100% project-based course where you will learn to build, track, and deploy a complete Machine Learning solution.

### Project Synopsis
The repository provides a complete example based on **Bank Customer Churn Prediction**. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a **Synopsis** (baseline example). Each team must choose their own dataset and objective, which must be validated by the tutor before proceeding.
